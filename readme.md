# searchPC

searchPC is a Streamlit-based web application designed to help users find and configure the ideal PC components tailored to their needs and budget. The application combines AI-powered recommendations with live search results to suggest components—from CPUs to storage—that match your desired use-case, whether for gaming, programming, machine learning, or professional work.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:**  
  Build your custom PC by providing your budget, intended purpose, and location via an intuitive sidebar.
  
- **AI-Powered Recommendations:**  
  Leverages Google's Gemini Pro to generate a comprehensive PC build recommendation that utilizes the entire budget precisely. The recommendation includes detailed components such as CPU, motherboard, GPU, RAM, storage, power supply, and cabinet.
  
- **Live Part Searches:**  
  Uses the [Serper.dev API](https://serper.dev/) to fetch up-to-date shopping results for various PC parts, ensuring recommendations are relevant to the current market.
  
- **Search Logging:**  
  User searches (budget, purpose, and location) are logged into a CSV file for analytics and debugging purposes.

## File Structure

- **app.py**  
  The main Streamlit application that sets up the UI, handles user inputs, and displays both the AI recommendation and detailed part recommendations.

- **parts_finder.py**  
  Contains the `PCPartsFinder` class which:
  - Validates API keys.
  - Calls the Serper.dev API to search for PC parts.
  - Integrates the AI recommendation into the part search process.

- **utils.py**  
  Provides helper functions for:
  - Validating user inputs.
  - Generating a detailed PC build recommendation using Google's Gemini API.
  - Logging search queries to a CSV file for later review.

- **.env.example**  
  An example environment file listing the required API keys:
  - `SERPER_API_KEY`: For the Serper.dev API.
  - `GEMINI_API_KEY`: For Google Gemini API access.

- **requirements.txt**  
  Lists all required Python packages such as Streamlit, Requests, python-dotenv, google-generativeai, and Pandas.

- **search_logs.csv**  
  (Automatically generated) Logs user search details including timestamp, purpose, budget, and location.

     ```

   - Edit the `.env` file to add your API keys:

     ```
     SERPER_API_KEY=your_serper_api_key_here
     GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
     ```

## Usage

1. **Start the Streamlit Application:**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Interact with the App:**

   - Click **Find PC Parts** to view:
     - **AI Recommendation:** A detailed, budget-exact PC build generated by Gemini.
     - **Part Recommendations:** A list of component options (CPU, GPU, etc.) sourced from live shopping data via Serper.dev.

## API Keys

- **Serper.dev API:**  
  Used to fetch shopping results for PC parts. Obtain your API key from [serper.dev](https://serper.dev/).

- **Google Gemini API:**  
  Used to generate detailed PC build recommendations. You can get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/).

Ensure both keys are correctly set in the `.env` file.
